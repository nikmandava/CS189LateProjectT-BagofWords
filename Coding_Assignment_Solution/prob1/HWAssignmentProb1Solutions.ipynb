    "### Motivation: In this problem we provide an introduction to a real world application of the Bag of Words Model: sentiment analysis and binary classification. The student will perform binary classification on two datasets: one Yelp Review dataset partitioned by low and highly rated reviews and another dataset of Airplane Tweets classified into positive and negative sentiment. The student starts off with data exploration. Afterwards, they create a simple logistic regression model with the only feature being word count, then implement bag of words features, then explore a number of modifications to the model in order to evaluate the tangible impact of using different variations and better understand the nuances of the model."

    "Here we explore the dataset of Yelp Reviews and Airplane Tweets. The Yelp dataset has a star rating of 1 to 5, so we extract the most polar reviews with 1 and 5 stars and classify them as -1 and 1 respectively. For Airplane Tweets, we translate the 'negative' and 'positive' sentiment labels into classes of -1 and 1. We initially load the data and do some exploratory analysis in order to learn more about the data we will be classifying and gain some insight into how to do so."

The most common words in positive reviews include words such as 'love', 'best', and 'recommend', which all clearly demonstrate positive senttiment. So these words overall seem to be good indicators for each class, as opposed to the words we saw before. They also show up very often in reviews so will be good at predicting class. \n",

Other words in tthis set are 'Late', 'delayed', and 'Cancelled', which makes sense as these are negative words that would imply dissatisfaction and a negative response. On the other hand, some words that appear in the most common list for positive tweets but not negative are 'thanks', 'love', 'best', and so on. Again, these words make sense as they have a positive connotation and thus would appear more often in positive sentiment tweets. As a result, these words seem to be good indicators of negative/positive sentiment as they appear more often in their respective classes, and thus should be weighted as such in our model. On the other hand, stop words and words that do not appear often as above would no be great predictors of class.\n",

    "<p style=\"color:blue\"> Yelp Reviews: The accuracy of 0.952 is significantly higher than any of the models so far. The combination of both the corrections for binary bag of words and allowing for negation did much better together than either of them individually. Ultimately, it can be seen that when the dataset gets more convoluted and the binary classification is not clearly divided the original Bag of Words featurization may not do as well as expected. Instead, modifications like the ones we made for binary Bag of Words and providing additional features for negation have the potential to result in large improvements in model performance and thus should be determined in an experimen. Additional summary level features can and should be added in order to improve the model further, such as length, punctuation, other dictionaries, and more.\n",
